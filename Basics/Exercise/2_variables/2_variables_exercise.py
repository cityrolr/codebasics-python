### Exercise: Python Variables
#1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
breakingPoint = 5
#2. Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables
birthYear = 1992
currentYear = 2023
age = currentYear - birthYear
print('You are ' + str(int(age)) + ' years old')
#3. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables
firstname = 'Julian '
middlename = 'no middle name '
lastname = 'Mair'

print('My name is ' + firstname + middlename + lastname)
#4. Answer which of these are invalid variable names: 
#   _nation
#   1record
#   record1
#   record_one
#   record-one
#   record^one
#   continue
